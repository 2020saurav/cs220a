One bit multiplexer uses OR (1), AND (2), NOT (1), total of 4 gates.

The 32 bit multiplexer is also effectively a (2X1) multiplexer that just selects between two 32 bit numbers by running a for loop over the number of bits in a 32 bit number.

In each iteration of the for loop, we have one multiplexer1 (using 4 gates) being called. Hence, for 32 loops, we have, effectively, used
4X32 = 128 gates

Generalizing, if we need to use a n-bit multiplexer, we need to run the iteration (each iteration uses 4 gates) n times. Hence, number of gates used :
4Xn = 4n 



Ans : 1 bit multiplexer - 4 gates
      32bit multiplexer - 128 gates
      n-bit multiplexer - 4n gates.
